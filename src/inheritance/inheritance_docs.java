 * ------inheritance----------
 * uses -
 * code re-usability
 * process of accessing properties and method is parent/base/super class
 * to child/derived/sub class is know as inheritance.
 * 
 * 
 * also know as IS-A relationship
 * its a generalization to specialization process
 * we can only inherit  only one class at a time
 * multiple inheritance does not support in java with class
 * but it happens with interface
 * 
 * we cant inherit private properties method and constructor
 * 'extends' keyword is used in inheritance
 * 
 * syntax-
 * child_class extends parent class{
 * 
 *  // properties: parent+child
 *  
 *  // methods: parent+child
 *  
 *  
 * }
 * 
 * e.g
 * 
 * class A{
 * 
 * }
 * 
 * class B extends A{
 * 
 * }
 * class c extends B{
 * 
 * }
